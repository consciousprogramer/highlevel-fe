## HighLevel FullStack Assessment: Backend

### Tech Stack
1. React & Next.js 14
3. TailwindCSS
4. Axios
2. react-hook-form


#### Local Development Setup:
1. clone the repo
2. install packages via yarn `yarn install` ( to install yarn `npm i -g yarn` )
4. need `.env.local` files to start the backend, these are already provided in the E-mail.
	1. be sure to change value in env if backend is running on different host/port.
5. to start the development run `yarn dev`
6. to run production build run `yarn build`
7. ib both cases, check the app on `http://localhost:3000`

The production backend is running on `http://52.66.17.184/`
