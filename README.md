This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## HighLevel FullStack Assessment: Backend

### Tech Stack
1. React & Next.js 14
3. TailwindCSS
4. Axios
2. react-hook-form


#### Local Development Setup:
1. clone the repo
2. install packages via yarn `yarn install` ( to install yarn `npm i -g yarn` )
4. need `.env.local` files to start the backend, these are already provided in the E-mail.
	1. be sure to change value in env if backend is running on different host/port.
5. to start the development run `yarn dev`
6. to run production build run `yarn build`
7. ib both cases, check the app on `http://localhost:3000`

The production backend is running on `http://52.66.17.184/`
